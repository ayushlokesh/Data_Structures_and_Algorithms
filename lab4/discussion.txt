1. What priority queue operations does each application require and with what relatively frequency (roughly)? e.g. few insertions, lots of checking for contains, as many pop min operations as insertions.

2. With what complexity does each of the five considered alternative data structures implement those operations? Your answer should be in Big-O. You don’t need to justify this here but you should make sure you know why (you’re expected to look these up and understand them, not necessarily compute them).

3. For each application, which data structure do you expect to be best?
